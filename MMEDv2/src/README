== Prerequisite libraries:

LibSVM (For normal binary SVMs): [http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ link]

We also require some matlab functions from Kevin Murphy's toolboxes. 
For your convenience, necessary functions are included in this bundle
You do not to download and install Kevin Murphy's toolboxes.

== Compilation:
  
> mex m_mexAMOC.cpp

== Run Matlab demos:

> m_main_synData.m: main function for experiments on synthetic data. This should take 10 mins. 
	
> m_main_CK(2): Experiment on Cohn Kanade dataset. The parameter 2 is for two runs. 
This takes around 8 mins. For reliable results, should run m_main_CK(10) for 10 runs.

> m_main_asl(2): Experiment on Australian sign language. The parameter 2 is for two runs. 
This takes around 20mins. For reliable results, should run m_main_asl(10) for 10 runs, which will take 150mins.


== Source code

The main code is contained in *.\/src*. The most important files are:

- M_MMED.m: main class for both MMED and Structure-Output SVMs. The main functions are:
	train: training either MMED or SOSVM. There are some tunable parameters in the function.
		The training code uses quadratic programming of Matlab. If you have Cplex, you can use
		quadratic programming of Cplex. Search for the text cplexqp and uncomment and comment approprate lines. 

	eval, eval_fast: for evaluation

- m_params.m: contains data structure signatures for some important parameters and variables. 	

- M_SegSVM.m: class for segment-based SVMs. Function M_SegSVM.test is useful for generating performance curves.

- M_FrmSVM.m: class for frame-based SVMs	

- m_getPerfCurve.m: code to generate performance curves.
